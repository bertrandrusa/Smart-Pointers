Question 1:
Write your answer here.
sharedPtr1.use_count() = 4 // There are 4 pointers sharing the same object

count (calling function) = 4  Within the function, there are 4 pointers sharing the same object
count (ptr)              = 1  // Outside the function, there is 1 pointer holding the object

Process finished with exit code 0

Question 2:
Write your answer here.
sharedPtr1.use_count() = 3  // There are now 3 pointers sharing the same object (one pointer less

count (calling function) = 3  // Within the function, there are 3 pointers sharing the same object
count (ptr)              = 1  // Outside the function, there is still 1 pointer holding the object

Process finished with exit code 0
